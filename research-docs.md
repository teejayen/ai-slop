## Scoring Framework

<div class="scoring-section">

### Business Focus Agent (/10)

Evaluates:
- Strategic value and business relevance
- Clear ROI framing
- Target audience alignment (executives, managers, practitioners)
- Actionable insights and recommendations
- Real-world applications

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Exceptional business focus with clear strategic value
- 7-8: Strong business relevance with good insights
- 5-6: Adequate business angle but could be stronger
- 3-4: Weak business focus, too technical or generic
- 0-2: No clear business value

### Quality Standards Agent (/10)

Evaluates:
- Australian English compliance (organisations, optimise, realise)
- No banned phrases ("unlock value," "game-changing")
- Proper Jekyll formatting (front matter, headings)
- Readability and structure
- Hyperlinks to sources

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: All standards met, no violations
- 7-8: Minor issues, easily fixed
- 5-6: Several violations requiring fixes
- 3-4: Major quality problems
- 0-2: Severe violations across multiple categories

### Substance Agent (/10)

Evaluates:
- Specific data points and examples vs. vague claims
- Named sources and attribution
- Critical perspective (questions hype, acknowledges nuance)
- Depth of analysis vs. surface-level observations
- Detection of "AI slop" patterns

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Highly substantive with specific examples, named sources, critical analysis
- 7-8: Above average substance, good data and examples
- 5-6: Adequate substance but some generic content
- 3-4: Mostly generic with limited specifics
- 0-2: Pure "slop" - vague, generic, no substance

## Production Threshold

**24/30 minimum required for publication**

Articles scoring below 24/30 require iteration and fixes before publication.

## Key Findings (Ongoing)

### Patterns Observed

- **American English violations** are the most common quality issue (requiring search-and-replace fixes)
- **Source attribution** significantly improves substance scores (hyperlinks critical)
- **Business focus** correlates with specific financial data and ROI framing
- **Critical perspective** (acknowledging failures, questioning hype) prevents generic output
- **Australian context** adds differentiation when genuinely integrated (not forced)

### What Works

✓ Specific statistics with hyperlinked sources
✓ Named companies or real-world examples
✓ Critical examination of failures (95% pilot failure rate)
✓ Organisational challenges alongside technical discussion
✓ Australian regulatory context (AICD, ASX, government guidance)
✓ Actionable strategic frameworks

### What Doesn't Work

✗ Vague claims ("experts say," "research shows") without attribution
✗ Generic strategic language without specifics
✗ Uncritical cheerleading of AI capabilities
✗ Listicles without depth
✗ American English (violates project standards)
✗ Banned phrases that signal "slop"

## Access to Raw Data
