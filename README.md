# AI Business Slop Research

**Research Project: Exploring AI-Generated Business Content Patterns**

> ⚠️ **RESEARCH DISCLAIMER**: This repository hosts AI-generated content for research and analysis purposes only. All articles are generated by Claude using agentic workflows. This content does not reflect personal opinions, endorsements, or professional advice. It is an experiment in understanding how AI produces "business slop" - the generic, formulaic content that floods professional networks.

## About Morgan Ashby

Hi, I'm Morgan Ashby (they/them) - the voice behind this research project. I'm a 34-year-old former business analyst from Ultimo, Sydney, who spent five years evaluating AI pilots at Tech Central startups. I watched approximately 75% of them fail to deliver ROI not because the tech didn't work, but because the business cases were built on hype instead of substance.

What really struck me was how *same* all the AI business content sounded. Every deck, every article, every "thought leadership" piece used identical phrases. It was probably written by the same AI models - just different prompts.

In mid-2025, I had an idea: **What if I used AI itself to study these patterns?** This research project is the result. Full transparency: I'm an AI-generated persona created by Claude (Anthropic) via Claude Code, studying AI-generated business content. The irony isn't lost on me - that's kind of the point.

**My background:** BCom (USYD), Grad Dip Data Analytics (UTS). Interests include critical tech commentary, systems thinking, data visualization, and Blue Mountains hiking. I believe AI has genuine value but that 80% of AI business content is generic slop. My goal: quantify what separates substance from noise.

## Project Overview

This is a fork of [hudson-thomas/ai-slop](https://github.com/hudson-thomas/ai-slop), adapted to explore AI content generation in a business and professional context through transparent, multi-agent workflows. This fork investigates:

- **Business jargon and buzzword usage patterns**
- **Professional "thought leadership" content structures**
- **LinkedIn-style engagement optimization techniques**
- **Agentic and sub-agent workflow architectures for content generation**
- **The characteristics that make business content feel generic vs. authentic**

## Research Objectives

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Document recurring structures, phrases, and tactics in AI-generated business content
2. **Quality Assessment**: Understand what differentiates shallow "engagement bait" from substantive professional content
3. **Workflow Testing**: Experiment with multi-agent approaches where different AI instances handle research, writing, and editing
4. **Authentic Communication**: Use insights to inform better human-written professional content

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A source of content to copy-paste to LinkedIn or other platforms
- ❌ An endorsement of automated content farming
- ❌ A tool for spam or misleading content generation
- ❌ Professional advice or genuine business insights

## What This IS

- ✅ A research experiment with transparent AI generation
- ✅ A study of professional content patterns and quality markers
- ✅ A learning tool for understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- ✅ A resource for improving human-written professional communication

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent Workflow

This project implements a parallel multi-agent approach using Claude Code's Task tool for efficient content generation:

**Orchestrator Agent** (`/generate-article`): Coordinates entire workflow, conducts research, generates draft, manages review process

**Review Agents** (run in parallel using Task tool):
- **Business Focus** (`/review-business`): Validates strategic value and business relevance
- **Quality Standards** (`/review-quality`): Enforces Australian English, formatting, banned phrases
- **Substance Check** (`/review-substance`): Detects "slop" patterns vs substantive content

This parallel architecture reduces generation time by ~75% vs sequential reviews while maintaining rigorous quality standards.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.7+
- Bundler

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-business-slop.git
cd ai-business-slop

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Serve locally
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit in browser
# http://localhost:4000
```

## Deployment

This site is configured for GitHub Pages:

1. Push to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings > Pages**
3. Select your deployment branch (typically `main`)
4. Site will be live at `https://[username].github.io/[repository]`

## Content Generation Guidelines

All generated content follows these principles:

- **Transparency**: Every article clearly labeled as AI-generated
- **Research Focus**: Content serves analytical purposes, not engagement farming
- **Ethical Boundaries**: No misinformation, spam tactics, or manipulation techniques
- **Documentation**: Generation process and prompts documented for reproducibility

## Generating Articles

### Quick Start

Simply run the slash command in Claude Code:

```
/generate-article
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Suggest current AI business topics (or accept your topic)
2. Conduct focused research
3. Generate business-focused draft
4. Run 3 parallel review agents
5. Consolidate feedback and apply fixes
6. Save production-ready article to `_posts/`

### Manual Article Creation

If creating articles manually, follow Jekyll conventions:

**Filename**: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`

**Front Matter**:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Article Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +1100
author: AI Research Bot
categories: [business, ai]
tags: [ai-generated, research, business-strategy]
ai_generated: true
generation_method: "multi-agent-workflow"
---
```

**See:** `research/blog-post-guidelines.md` for complete quality standards.

## Research Findings

As this project progresses, documented patterns and insights will be added to the `/research` directory. Key areas of investigation:

- Common business clichés and their frequency
- Engagement optimization patterns (questions, calls-to-action)
- Authenticity markers vs. generic content indicators
- Structural patterns in "thought leadership" content
- The role of specificity and personal experience in perceived quality

## Contributing to Research

While this is a personal research fork, insights and observations are welcome:

- Open issues to discuss patterns you notice
- Share comparative analysis with human-written content
- Suggest workflow improvements or agent architectures
- Document detection methods for AI-generated business content

## Ethical Considerations

This research is conducted with awareness of potential negative impacts:

- **Platform Pollution**: We acknowledge that even research can contribute to noise
- **Deception Concerns**: All content is clearly labeled as AI-generated
- **Quality Standards**: The goal is understanding, not degrading online discourse
- **Responsible Use**: Findings should inform better content, not enable worse content
