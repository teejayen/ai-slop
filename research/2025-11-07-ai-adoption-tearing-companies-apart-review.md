## Business Focus Review (9/10)

### Strengths
- Exceptional strategic framing around a concrete, quantifiable business problem (42% organisational fracture rate)
- Strong use of multiple data sources to establish credibility and business case (Writer's 2025 report, eMarketer, Deloitte, PwC)
- Clear articulation of financial consequences: ROI failure (only 1 in 4 initiatives deliver), specific cost categories (productivity loss, talent attrition, opportunity cost)
- Highly actionable strategic imperatives with clear implementation guidance for executives
- Excellent target audience alignment—written for C-suite and senior leadership with appropriate business terminology
- Real-world business implications throughout: departmental silos, power struggles, active employee sabotage
- Strong risk management framing that connects organisational readiness to competitive outcomes
- Specific, measurable differentiators (80% vs 37% success rates with formal strategy; 43-point gap; 40-point investment gap)

### Weaknesses
- Could benefit from one concrete company example (anonymised case study showing fracture vs. success)
- The "what good looks like" section could include a brief implementation timeline or sequencing guidance
- Missing discussion of board-level governance considerations or how to present AI strategy to boards

### Recommendations
- Add a brief anonymised case study comparing two companies—one that experienced the 42% fracture and one that avoided it through formal strategy
- Include a simple decision framework or diagnostic tool executives could use to assess their organisation's readiness (e.g., "5 questions to ask before scaling AI")
- Consider adding a paragraph on board engagement and how to frame AI organisational readiness at the governance level
- Could reference specific governance frameworks or change management methodologies that have proven effective

### Named Sources
All sources hyperlinked with specific URLs:
- Writer's 2025 Enterprise AI Adoption Report (1,600 knowledge workers surveyed)
- eMarketer
- Inc. Magazine
- Deloitte
- Stack AI
- Second Talent
- Kan Software
- AI21
- Bloola
- PwC

### Critical Perspective
Strong critical stance throughout:
- Explicitly challenges vendor narratives ("most vendor decks won't tell you")
- C-suite perception gaps vs. employee reality
- Challenges assumption that technology is the primary barrier
- Questions the rush to deploy without organisational readiness
- Acknowledges systemic challenges including active sabotage, power struggles, political battles

### Depth of Analysis
Solid analytical framework:
- Distinguishes between symptoms (technical issues) and root causes (organisational dynamics)
- Explains the mechanism of fracture (power redistribution, role redefinition)
- Connects organisational readiness to financial outcomes
- Provides causal analysis for ROI failures
- Synthesises multiple data sources into coherent argument
- Offers strategic framework (3 imperatives) grounded in evidence

### AI Slop Indicators Detected
- Minor: "In 2025" time marker (though contextually appropriate given 2025 report date)
- Minor: "The Path Forward" as final section header (somewhat generic)
- Minor: Three-point strategic framework format (common AI article structure, but here it's well-supported)

### Recommendations
- Add 1-2 specific company examples (named organisations that experienced fracture or success)
- Include at least one named executive or expert quote
- Consider adding a brief case study sidebar illustrating one of the fracture patterns
- The "power dynamics" section could benefit from a specific example of a turf war or middle management resistance scenario
