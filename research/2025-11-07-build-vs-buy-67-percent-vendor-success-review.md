## Topic Selection Rationale

**Why This Topic (Morgan Ashby's Perspective):**

This topic perfectly aligns with Morgan Ashby's analytical background and interests:

2. **Critical of corporate hubris:** The "build trap" challenges the common executive belief that "we can build it ourselves"
3. **Real business challenges:** Addresses talent shortages, hidden costs, and opportunity cost—practical problems, not theoretical AI discussions
4. **Strategic resource allocation:** Former business analyst perspective on make-vs-buy decisions with financial implications
5. **Questions marketing claims:** Critiques the seduction of internal builds and examines what actually works versus what sounds good

**Strategic Value:**
- Actionable framework for executives making vendor selection decisions
- Backed by comprehensive MIT research across 300 deployments
- Addresses current business reality (86% talent concerns, 61% infrastructure skills gaps)
- Practical hybrid model guidance for sophisticated organisations
