## Recommendations for Future Articles

### What Worked Well

1. **Persona-driven topic selection** - Automatic selection based on Morgan's interests/background saved time and aligned perfectly with voice

### Workflow Refinements

- **Pre-flight check:** Automated Australian English validation before review phase
- **Source tracking:** Capture hyperlinks during research phase for immediate integration
- **Expert identification:** WebSearch queries should specifically look for quotable named experts
