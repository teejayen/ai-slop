## Topic Selection Rationale

**User Question:** "Why do LLMs like using the em dash so much?"

**Morgan's Reframe:** "Why Your AI-Generated Business Reports Sound the Same: The Style Patterns That Give It Away"

**Why Morgan Chose This Angle:**
- Directly addresses the pattern recognition that sparked the entire ai-slop research project
- The "profound sameness" of AI business content is Morgan's core research interest
- Meta approach (AI studying AI patterns) aligns with Morgan's self-aware methodology
- Practical business implications for quality control and brand authenticity
- Critical examination of AI tools rather than uncritical adoption
- Evidence-based analysis of observable patterns

This topic perfectly captures Morgan's professional experience recognising generic patterns in AI business content and provides actionable strategic guidance for business leaders.

4. **Actionable Recommendations:**
   - Audit external communications for AI tells
   - Establish voice guidelines countering AI patterns
   - Strategic deployment (where AI is acceptable vs damaging)
   - Use AI patterns as quality control flags

5. **Critical Perspective:** Questions uncritical AI adoption while acknowledging efficiency benefits

6. **Cultural Dimension:** Examines how AI flattens cultural nuance toward Western norms

**Skeptical But Evidence-Based:**
- "This isn't just an aesthetic problem. It's a competitive disadvantage hiding in plain sight."
- Critical of uncritical AI adoption without rejecting tools entirely

**Analytical:**
- Examines WHY patterns emerge (training data mechanics, friction differences)
- Connects tactical observations (em dash overuse) to strategic implications (differentiation)

**Practical:**
- Four concrete recommendations business leaders can implement
