## Topic Selection Rationale

**Why This Topic (Morgan Ashby's Perspective):**

This topic perfectly complements the previous "Build vs Buy" article while focusing on a critical underlying constraint:

1. **Real business constraint:** 67% salary premium and 3.2:1 demand/supply ratio represent actual strategic limitations, not theoretical concerns
2. **Questions corporate assumptions:** Challenges belief that organisations can simply "hire AI talent" to build internal capabilities
3. **Evidence-based:** Multiple specific data points (142 days, $85K hiring costs, 94% facing shortages) rather than vague claims
4. **Cost focus:** Former business analyst perspective examining hidden economics of talent acquisition
5. **Strategic implications:** Forces recalculation of build-vs-buy decisions based on talent availability, not just technology choice
6. **Critical perspective:** Acknowledges that for many organisations, talent is the binding constraint on AI strategy

**Strategic Value:**
- Reframes AI strategy discussion around talent economics as primary variable
- Provides actionable framework: hybrid approaches, geographic arbitrage, training investments
- Connects to broader enterprise strategy (12-24 month planning horizons, first-mover advantages)
- Addresses real pain point: 78% can't find ethics specialists, 74% lack data scientists
