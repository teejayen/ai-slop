In early 2023, headlines screamed about [$200,000 salaries for "prompt engineers"](https://www.salesforceben.com/prompt-engineering-jobs-are-obsolete-in-2025-heres-why/) - people whose entire job was crafting effective prompts for AI systems. Tech executives told Bloomberg and Fortune that this was the hot new career path, essential for AI adoption.

Two years later, [a Wall Street Journal investigation found that tech executives couldn't provide examples of anyone actually employed with the job title "prompt engineer."](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead) What started as a promising career path has practically dissolved within just two years.

But here's what actually happened: companies didn't abandon prompt engineering. They made it everyone's job instead.

## From Job Title to Universal Skill

As someone who evaluated AI pilots at Sydney startups, I watched this evolution firsthand. In 2023, companies were posting roles for dedicated "prompt engineers" with salaries ranging from $180K to $300K. By mid-2024, those same companies were embedding prompt engineering training into existing roles: product managers, data scientists, customer support teams, marketing analysts.

The shift mirrors what happened with "webmaster" in the late 1990s. Initially a specialised role, web skills became distributed across marketing, IT, and communications teams. The job title vanished whilst the capability became universal.

[According to experts tracking this transition](https://www.cio.com/article/4080592/context-engineering-improving-ai-by-moving-beyond-the-prompt.html), prompt engineering "became an ability within a job title, not an independent job title." Companies realised prompt engineering is usually part of another role, and whilst it can boost value and salary potential, it's not generally a standalone $200K job for most organisations.

## The Productivity Data That Explains Why

Here's the business case that killed the standalone role: [teams without proper AI prompting training see 60% lower productivity gains](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/the-biggest-ai-adoption-challenges) compared to those with structured education programmes.

That stat means two things:
1. **Prompt engineering capability matters** - you can't just give people ChatGPT and hope for the best
2. **Everyone needs it** - confining the skill to a specialised team creates a bottleneck

When only your "prompt engineers" know how to get good results from AI systems, every request flows through them. When your entire product team, customer support staff, and finance analysts know how to craft effective prompts, they get answers immediately and iterate faster.

The distributed model won on speed and ROI.

## What Actually Replaces Dedicated Prompt Engineers

### 1. Context Engineering as the New Discipline

Abhyankar, an expert tracking AI deployment patterns, notes that ["in the early stages of experimentation, prompt engineering was sufficient to guide model behaviour and tone. As organisations transition from pilots to production-scale deployments, they're finding that prompt engineering cannot deliver the accuracy, memory, or governance required in complex environments on its own."](https://www.cio.com/article/4080592/context-engineering-improving-ai-by-moving-beyond-the-prompt.html)

**Context engineering** - providing AI systems with broader organisational context, document repositories, approval workflows, and integration with enterprise systems - is where the real technical expertise sits. This isn't a prompt crafting skill; it's AI architecture and integration work done by data engineers, ML engineers, and solutions architects.

### 2. AI-Generated Prompts Outperforming Humans

New research suggests [prompt engineering is best done by the AI model itself](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead), with AI-generated prompts outperforming human-crafted ones in both quality and speed.

If the AI can optimise its own prompts better than humans can, the dedicated "prompt engineer" role becomes obsolete twice over: first because everyone needs the skill, second because automation handles optimisation.

### 3. Embedded Prompt Skills in Existing Roles

Instead of hiring teams of pure prompt specialists, firms are [embedding prompt engineering skills into roles like AI Developer, Data Scientist, Product Manager, or Conversational Designer](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/ai-prompt-engineering-in-2025-sander-schulhoff). Whilst job postings for "Prompt Engineer" positions have grown 135.8%, these are typically data science or ML engineering roles where prompt design is one component, not the entire scope.

## The ROI Reality Check

Marc Fernandez, Neurologyca Chief Strategy Officer, explains the shift: ["The AI hype bubble isn't bursting, it's maturing. Today we're seeing enterprises expecting more from their investments, wanting to have a clear picture of ROI that aligns with KPIs and operational necessities."](https://techinformed.com/ai-roi-era/)

When executives scrutinise AI spending with actual ROI requirements, dedicated prompt engineering teams don't survive the cost-benefit analysis. Training existing employees in prompt skills costs less and delivers faster value than building a separate function.

The numbers back this up:
- [Only about one in four AI initiatives actually deliver expected ROI](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise)
- [Fewer than 20% have been fully scaled across the enterprise](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise)
- Many enterprises still struggle to quantify ROI from AI initiatives

In this environment, a dedicated team doing only prompt optimisation is a luxury most organisations can't justify.

## What This Means for Australian Organisations

### The Distributed Skill Investment

Australia's AI adoption patterns mirror global trends: [larger Australian organisations lead adoption, with retail trade, health, and education as leading sectors](https://www.industry.gov.au/news/ai-adoption-australian-businesses-2025-q1). Australian companies face the same decision: hire prompt engineering specialists or embed the capability across teams.

Given the data showing 60% lower productivity without training, the strategic move is clear: **invest in prompt engineering training for existing staff, not prompt engineering hires.**

[The Australian government recognises this](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/australia-national-ai-plan-investment-capabilities-2025/), establishing "AI Adopt" centres to upskill SMEs and releasing micro skill courses through TAFE NSW. The focus is on distributing AI capability, not creating AI specialist silos.

### The $280 Billion Context

Australia expects [$280 billion in economic benefits from AI adoption by 2030](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-in-australia/). That value doesn't come from hiring prompt engineers - it comes from thousands of employees across retail, healthcare, education, and professional services using AI effectively in their existing roles.

Telstra's approach illustrates this: [working with Cognizant to reimagine engineering using AI agents for process automation](https://www.industry.gov.au/news/ai-adoption-australian-businesses-2025-q1), they're seeing gains in quality, velocity, and efficiency. Not by hiring prompt engineers, but by embedding AI capabilities into engineering workflows.

### The Training ROI Equation

Here's the calculation Australian executives should run:

**Option A: Hire Dedicated Prompt Engineers**
- Salary: $150K-$200K per role (Australian market rates)
- Coverage: Bottleneck for all AI-related requests across organisation
- Scalability: Limited by headcount
- Retention risk: High (specialist roles, competitive market)

**Option B: Train Existing Employees**
- Training investment: $2K-$5K per employee (micro-credentials, workshops)
- Coverage: Distributed across hundreds of roles
- Scalability: Every employee using AI tools becomes more effective
- Productivity gain: 60% higher than untrained teams

Option B delivers better ROI and scales faster.

## What "Good Enough" Prompt Engineering Looks Like

Most organisations don't need prompt engineering excellence - they need prompt engineering competence distributed across teams.

**"Good enough" means:**
- Employees can get usable outputs from ChatGPT, Claude, or internal AI tools without specialist help
- Product teams can iterate on AI features without waiting for prompt optimisation consultations
- Customer support staff can craft prompts that retrieve accurate knowledge base answers
- Analysts can use AI to summarise data without forwarding requests to a centralised team

**"Excellence" - context engineering, fine-tuning, production-scale optimisation - remains specialist work done by ML engineers and AI architects. But that's not prompt engineering; that's AI platform development.**

## The Uncomfortable Questions for Organisations Still Hiring "Prompt Engineers"

If you're currently posting roles for dedicated prompt engineers, ask:

### 1. What Will This Person Do That AI Can't Automate?

If the role is primarily optimising prompt phrasing and testing variations, [AI-generated prompts already outperform human-crafted ones](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead). You're hiring for a task AI does better.

### 2. Why Not Train Your Product/Data/Support Teams Instead?

If your organisation needs better AI outputs, training existing staff delivers faster results than hiring specialists who become a request bottleneck.

### 3. Is This Really Context Engineering Work?

If the role involves building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, integrating AI with enterprise data, or designing governance frameworks, that's ML engineering or AI architecture work - not prompt engineering. Job title matters for attracting the right talent.

## What Replaces the Hype

The $200K prompt engineering job was always outlier data reported as mainstream. Early adopters paid premium rates for scarce expertise in 2022-2023. By 2025, that expertise is commoditised through training programmes, AI automation, and distributed capability.

What remains valuable:
- **Context engineering expertise** (AI architecture, integration, governance)
- **Domain expertise + AI fluency** (product managers who know both their product and how to leverage AI)
- **Training and enablement** (building internal AI capability across organisations)

None of these are "prompt engineer" roles - they're existing roles augmented with AI skills or specialised AI platform roles requiring broader technical expertise.

## The Strategic Shift for 2025

Australian organisations deploying AI need to shift from "Do we hire prompt engineers?" to "How do we make prompt competence universal across our teams?"

That means:
1. **Embed prompt training in onboarding** for any role using AI tools
2. **Build prompt engineering into job expectations** for data, product, and customer-facing roles
3. **Invest in context engineering capability** (the actual technical depth work)
4. **Measure productivity gains** from AI tools to quantify training ROI

Organisations still treating prompt engineering as a standalone specialisation are structuring for 2023's reality, not 2025's.

## The Pattern Recognition

This isn't the first time a hyped "essential new role" dissolved into distributed capability:

- **2000s: "Social media manager"** → Now every marketing role includes social
- **2010s: "Mobile app specialist"** → Now every product team designs for mobile
- **2020s: "Prompt engineer"** → Now every knowledge worker crafts prompts

The pattern: when a capability becomes universal, the specialist role disappears. The skill remains, embedded everywhere.

Prompt engineering followed this arc faster than previous examples because AI itself accelerated the learning curve and automated optimisation.

## The Takeaway for Business Leaders

If you're budgeting for AI capability in 2025:
- Don't hire teams of prompt engineers (the job title is already obsolete)
- Do invest in prompt engineering training for existing staff (60% productivity difference)
- Do hire ML engineers and AI architects for context engineering and platform work
- Do measure the ROI of AI tools + training against baseline productivity

The $200K prompt engineering job that dominated headlines never represented mainstream reality. It was early-adopter premium pricing reported as if typical.

By 2025, prompt engineering is like email or spreadsheets: a foundational skill everyone needs, not a job title anyone holds.

The organisations winning with AI aren't the ones with the biggest prompt engineering teams. They're the ones where every employee knows how to get value from AI tools in their existing role.

That's not a job title. That's organisational capability.
