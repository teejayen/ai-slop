# The AI Build Trap: Why Two-Thirds of Vendor Partnerships Succeed While Internal Projects Fail Twice as Often

When MIT researchers analysed 300 AI deployments across enterprise organisations, they uncovered a striking pattern: purchasing AI tools from specialised vendors succeeded 67% of the time, while internal builds succeeded only one-third as often. That's a 2:1 success ratio that should fundamentally reshape how executives approach AI strategy—yet most organisations continue falling into the build trap.

The numbers tell a sobering story. Of the approximately $30-40 billion spent annually on generative AI pilots, [95% of projects stall](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) without delivering measurable impact on profit and loss statements. Behind these failures lies a critical strategic choice that many organisations get wrong: the decision to build AI capabilities internally rather than partner with vendors who've already solved the problem.

## The Seduction of "We Can Build This"

The appeal of building AI internally is straightforward. Executives envision complete control over their technology stack, customisation to exact specifications, and retention of intellectual property. The pitch sounds compelling: "Why pay ongoing vendor fees when we can build exactly what we need and own it outright?"

This logic has led countless organisations down an expensive path. What looks like a cost-saving measure on initial budget projections becomes a resource drain that rarely delivers promised returns. The [MIT research](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/), led by Aditya Challapally from MIT Media Lab's NANDA Initiative and based on 150 interviews with leaders and a survey of 350 employees, reveals why this happens: organisations fundamentally underestimate what it takes to succeed with AI.

## The Hidden Economics of Building

Internal AI projects fail for reasons that aren't immediately visible in initial business cases. The first challenge is talent. Currently, [86% of organisations](https://www.flexential.com/resources/report/2025-state-ai-infrastructure) report concerns about acquiring the specialised talent needed to meet AI goals, with 61% identifying skills gaps in managing specialised computing infrastructure—up from 53% just twelve months ago. These aren't entry-level positions. AI engineers, machine learning specialists, and infrastructure experts command premium salaries, and there simply aren't enough of them to meet demand.

Beyond hiring challenges, there's the learning gap. MIT researchers identified this as a critical failure point: people and organisations simply don't understand how to design workflows that capture AI's benefits while minimising downside risks. Building AI tools requires not just technical capability but deep domain expertise in where and how AI creates value. Vendors develop this expertise across hundreds of implementations. Internal teams build it from scratch with each project.

Then there's the opportunity cost. While internal teams spend 12-18 months building what might become a functional AI system, competitors using vendor solutions deploy in weeks and start capturing value immediately. The [Forrester Total Economic Impact study](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-roi) found organisations using established AI platforms achieved payback in just six months, with 383% ROI over three years. Internal builds rarely match this velocity.

## Why Vendors Win

The 67% success rate for vendor partnerships isn't accidental. These organisations bring battle-tested solutions refined across multiple implementations. When JPMorgan deployed its COIN platform for contract review, it automated the equivalent of 360,000 staff hours annually—over 40 years of manual work. Walmart saved $75 million in a single fiscal year through AI-driven supply chain optimisation. Mercari anticipates 500% ROI while reducing employee workloads by 20%.

These results stem from vendors having already navigated the failure modes that sink internal projects. They've optimised for specific use cases, built infrastructure that scales, and developed workflows that integrate with enterprise systems. More importantly, they've learned which AI applications actually deliver business value versus which merely sound impressive.

The MIT research highlighted a particularly instructive finding: more than half of generative AI budgets flow to sales and marketing tools, yet the biggest ROI appears in back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations. Vendors focused on these high-ROI applications bring proven frameworks for implementation. Internal teams often chase the flashier applications without this strategic clarity.

## The Emerging Blended Model

Smart organisations aren't simply choosing build or buy—they're pursuing hybrid strategies that leverage vendor strengths while retaining strategic differentiation. The dominant pattern in 2025 involves buying vendor platforms and adding custom in-house layers for last-mile components like retrieval systems, prompts, and evaluators. This keeps strategic intellectual property in-house while avoiding the trap of rebuilding commodity infrastructure.

Multi-vendor ecosystems have become the norm. In [Andreessen Horowitz's 2025 enterprise survey](https://a16z.com/ai-enterprise-2025/), 37% of respondents now use five or more models, up from 29% the previous year. This isn't about avoiding vendor lock-in—it's about model differentiation by use case. Different AI models excel at different tasks, and sophisticated organisations build infrastructure that routes work to the most effective solution.

The budget data reveals how AI is maturing. Innovation spending on large language models dropped from 25% to just 7% of budgets as enterprises shift AI costs to centralised IT and business unit budgets. This reflects growing sentiment that generative AI is no longer experimental but essential to business operations. That shift changes the economics of build versus buy. Experimental projects might justify custom builds; essential infrastructure demands proven solutions.

## Strategic Recommendations for Executives

The evidence suggests a clear framework. Start with vendor solutions for any AI capability that's been successfully commercialised. If established platforms exist that solve 80% of your requirement, the mathematics of building that final 20% internally rarely makes sense. Your differentiation comes from how you deploy AI, not from rebuilding foundational technology.

For organisations committed to AI as a core competency, the hybrid approach offers a pragmatic path. Partner with vendors for infrastructure, models, and proven capabilities. Build internally only for genuinely unique requirements where no vendor solution exists and where the capability creates true competitive advantage—not merely solves a common problem in a slightly different way.

Most importantly, recognise that the 67% versus 33% success rates aren't destiny. They reflect current organisational capabilities around AI. Vendor partnerships succeed more often because they access expertise, infrastructure, and proven methodologies that most organisations lack. Building that internally takes years and requires sustained investment in talent, infrastructure, and learning from failures.

The question isn't whether your organisation can eventually build effective AI systems internally. The question is whether the investment required to reach vendor-level capability delivers better returns than deploying proven solutions now and focusing internal resources on how AI transforms your specific business operations.

For most organisations, that calculation favours partnerships. The 2:1 success ratio suggests the market has already voted.
